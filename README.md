# cordova-plugin-speech-recognition-feat-siri

This plugin provides access to Speech Recognition API(Apple SFSpeechRecognizer).

<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/SpeakToMe/Introduction/Intro.html">Build&amp;Runtime Requirements</a>

It is not available until after the `deviceready` event.

## Installation

    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-speech-recognition-feat-siri


## Usage

### Methods

- `SpeechRecognitionFeatSiri.recordButtonTapped`

#### SpeechRecognitionFeatSiri.recordButtonTapped

The tap of the toggle button on the UI indicates the start and stop of the speech recognition.

   
    SpeechRecognitionFeatSiri.recordButtonTapped([LimitationSeconds], [locale], onSuccess, onError)


- __LimitationSeconds__:  Limitation seconds of Speech Recognition. _(String)_

- __locale__:  The locale specified when executing speech recognition. _(String)_


    The locale that can be specified with this plugin (Only locale supported by Siri API (SFSpeechRecognizer) can be specified(as of April 2017).) 
    "": defaults to the system locale set on the device.



- __onSuccess__: Call back when the API call to the voice recognition was successful. _(Function)_

- __onError__: Call back when the API call of speech recognition has failed. _(Function)_

#### Return Value

#####on Success(returnMessage) : 

There are three ways to obtain the result of speech recognition.

1. Your application calls the plug-in method twice at the timing of start and end of speech recognition.

    1. The voice input between the first and the second call will be converted as into character type and will be returned to the caller.

    2. Therefore, at the time of the first method call, it is just waiting for voice input.<br />
    Because the plug-in does not control the user interface, please implement the user interface of speech recognition state in the app side.

    3. At method call the second time, it returns of analyzing the result of speech recognition as a character type.


2. After the sound input by the microphone, when a certain period of time elapses with no voice, the speech recognition is automatically ended and the text is returned to the caller.


3. When the upper limit of the speech recognition time(LimitationSeconds) specified by the method is exceeded, the speech recognition is automatically ended and the text is returned to the caller



#####on Error(errorMessage) : 

These error string is returned from the plug-in.

|return value(type: string)|description|
|:--|:--|
|"commandArg(recognitionLimitSec)IsNotString"|Invalid argument. specify the character type in the argument "limitationSeconds".|
|"recognitionLimitSecTypeInvalid"|Invalid argument. specify the character type that can be interpreted as a numerical value to the argument "limitationSeconds".|
|"commandArg(locale)IsNotString"|Invalid argument. specify the character type in the argument "locale".|
|"commandArg(localeIdentifier)Invalid"|Invalid argument. The locale is not supported by the Siri API (SFSpeechRecognizer).|
|"timeOut"|Interrupted the speech recognition. Because it exceeds the upper limit(argument "limitationSeconds") of the specified time.|
|"pluginIsDisabled"|Plug-ins can not be used for any reason.|


#### Example1

    function doSpeechRecognition() {
	    if(SpeechRecognitionFeatSiri) {
           SpeechRecognitionFeatSiri.recordButtonTapped(
               '15',  // ex. 15 seconds limitation for Speech
               'ja-JP', // ex. locale: japanese, Japan
               function(returnMessage){
                   console.log(returnMessage); // onSuccess
               },
               function(errorMessage) {
                   console.log(errorMessage); // onError
               }
           )
        }
    };
    
#### Example2(use system locale.)

    function doSpeechRecognition() {
	    if(SpeechRecognitionFeatSiri) {
           SpeechRecognitionFeatSiri.recordButtonTapped(
               '15',  // ex. 15 seconds limitation for Speech
               '', // defaults to the system locale set on the device.
               function(returnMessage){
                   console.log(returnMessage); // onSuccess
               },
               function(errorMessage) {
                   console.log(errorMessage); // onError
               }
           )
        }
    };

## About this plugin's user interface

This plugin does not provide a graphical user interface.<br />
We are not planning to provide it in the future.<br />
Because it is a plug-in of Apache Cordoba which is a hybrid application.<br />
We believe that our plugin should not restrict the design of your application.<br />
Please implement sophisticated GUI designed for application.<br />
